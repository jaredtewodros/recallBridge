## IMPLEMENTATION SPECS (ARCHIVE)

This file was the original single-file implementation spec. To avoid large files and context-window issues, specs have been split into focused per-feature files under `.codex/specs/`.

See `00_INDEX.md` in the same folder for links to the per-feature specs and their current statuses.

Kept as an archive for history; do not edit this file. Add or update the per-feature spec files instead.
