# P2 — Roadmap / Nice-to-have

Purpose: Track longer-term improvements and non-blocking enhancements.

Items:

- P2-1: Unit tests & CI for static checks (no deploy)
- P2-2: Automated snapshot export of sheet headers to `docs/` to detect schema drift
- P2-3: Metrics logging for delivery/click rates (e.g., periodic export to CSV/BigQuery)

Notes:
- These are out-of-scope for pilot MVP but important for scaling beyond pilot.
